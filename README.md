# ATP-Tennis-Simulation:
This project aims to assess the state of a ATP tennis match through a Monte-Carlo based simulation approach that takes into account each player's serving and returning ability from any scoreline. 

## Features:

1) The first feature this model calculates is **win probability**, which simulates a tennis match from a predetermined scoreline and gives the percentage of times those simulations ended in a win for a specific player.
2) The second feature this model calculates is **leverage**, which is the difference in win probability depending on whether a player scores or does not score -- essentially leverage aims to quantify the "importance" of a particular point in the match by looking at what the win probabilities would be under two different realities.

## Sample Match: Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal (2008 Wimbledon)

To display and test my findings, I calculated win probability and leverage at every point in the Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal 2008 Wimbledon Final epic that went into 5 sets and was extremely close. The results 

## Further Study and Applications:

While the model is quite simple, the power of simulation is immense and this model can
